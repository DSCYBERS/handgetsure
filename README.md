## 1️⃣ Executive Summary <a name="executive-summary"></a>

This project develops a **real-time, touchless human-computer interface** that interprets hand gestures using computer vision and AI to control system operations. By leveraging Google Mediapipe for hand landmark detection and machine learning for gesture classification, the system enables users to interact with computers naturally without physical contact.

**Key Innovation:** Context-aware gesture recognition that adapts to active applications, making the same gesture perform different actions based on user context (browsing, presentations, media playback, etc.).
